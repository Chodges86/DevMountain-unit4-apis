1. Check if the POST request accept params, queries, and/or a body. Which one(s) and what information is it expecting to be sent?

It accepts a body that contains a JSON object: 
{
    "text": "Your text here"
}

2. What data type does the GET request return?

Returns an array of all the posts

3. What would the URL look like for deleting the post with the id 555? (This post does not exist anymore, but the syntax is the same for existing posts, )

DELETE:  https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts?id=1457

4. List the possible response codes from the GET request at ‘/posts/filter’

200 - Returns an array of filtered posts
409 - Request query is missing required text property

5. Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:

{
    "text": "Caleb"
}

6. What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your faovrite color instead of your name?

https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=1461
{
    "text": "blue"
}

7. What is the URL to get posts that contain the text “blue”?

https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=blue

8. Make a request to GET all the posts. What are the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)

application/json; charset=utf-8

9. What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?

Request was missing req.query.id or req.body.text

10. What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?

It ignores the query and returns all the posts.

The endpoint in the server is not setup to return results based on params only to return the entire database of posts
